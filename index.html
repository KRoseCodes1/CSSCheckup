            <p>So you've been sorted into Gryffindor. What now? Well, now its time to run off and do whatever brave thing you've always wanted to do.</p>
            <p>Gryffindors aren't only known for being courageous, they also have a knack for getting into trouble.  Have you ever:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blown up your aunt?</li>
                <li>Wandered into a forbiddon corridor by accident?</li>
                <li>Happened accross a diary filled with the worst kind of dark magic imaginable?</li>
                <li>Gotten chosen by the Goblet of Fire even though you never put your name in in the first place?</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="slytherin">If the answer to <b>any</b> of the above is yes, then you're in the right place! If the answer to all of the above was no, then you should probably go back and get resorted, you slimy Slytherin.</p>
